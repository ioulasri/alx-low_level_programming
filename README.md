### When you encounter a problem as a programmer, there are some helpful steps you can take to overcome it.
- One such step is to read your code aloud to track down the bug. Another useful strategy is to imagine that a programmer friend is sitting next to you and explain your code to them. This will help you to identify the issue and if you get stuck, your imaginary friend can ask you questions to guide you in the right direction.

- As a C programmer, it's natural to get a bit carried away with your code, but don't worry - this is all part of the process. In fact, talking through your code can even help you to identify which parts require comments and what those comments should say.

- So, the next time you get stuck, try reading your code aloud or explaining it to an imaginary friend, and see if it helps you to find the solution. And remember, as a C programmer, you're already a little bit "mental" - embrace it!
