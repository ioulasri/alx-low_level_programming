###C PROGRAMMING PROJECT: 0x00. C - Hello, World
Welcome to the first C project in the Alx Africa curriculum. This project covers the basics of compilation and C programming. Below are the files and scripts included in this project:

##0-preprocessor
This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The input is as follows: gcc -E $CFILE -o c.

##1-compiler
This script compiles a C file but does not link it. The input is as follows: gcc -c $CFILE.

##2-assembler
This script generates the assembly code of a C file and saves it in an output file. The input is as follows: gcc $CFILE -S.

##3-name
This script compiles a C file and creates an executable named "cisfun". The input is as follows: gcc $CFILE -o cisfun.

##4-puts.c
This C program prints the following string: "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a new line.

##5-printf.c
This C program prints the following string: "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.

##6-size.c
This C program prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

##100-intel
This script generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C file and saves it in an output file.

##101-quote.c
This C program prints the following string to the standard error: "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19," followed by a new line.

To run any of these scripts or programs, use your text editor of choice to create and access the file on insert mode. Make sure the first line of the file is #!/bin/bash, and then use the command chmod u+x filename to convert the file to a script. Check the respective files to see the code.

Thank you for checking out this project!
